Hi there! I am a physicist turned climate scientist with interests in atmospherc fluid flows, turbulence, thermal flows, clouds, rainfall. I am currently employed as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Atmospheric Transport Processes group](https://flexteam.univie.ac.at/) in the Department of Meteorology, University of Vienna. My current responsibilities include research on topics of atmospheric transport, development of the Flexpart model, teaching undergraduate and graduate level courses, and mentoring Master's thesis projects. I have a PhD in physics with expertise in fluid dynamics, turbulence, convection, and high performance computing systems. 

In my free time I enjoy playing [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/lokahithagasthya), going on a run or curling up with a good (e-)book. 

I'm currently reading ["India: A Million Mutinies Now"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55676.India) by [V.S. Naipaul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._S._Naipaul) (December 2025). 

## Current Research
I am currently interested in how turbulence above the atmospheric boundary layer (usually between 100 m to 3 km above the surface) impacts the transport of aerosols and trace gases in the atmosphere. This has important implications for the mixing of space debris during satellite re-entry, transport of gases across the tropopause and the distribution of sulphur aerosols under future possible geo-engineering experiments. 

The dynamics of moist convection holds many mysteries, particularly related to the updraft speed in clouds. Together with collaborators, I am studying the mechanisms that set the updraft velocity in a particular cloud and how well this can be predicted from pre-storm conditions. We use some exciting new tools like Distribution Regression and Equation Discovery.

## Previous Work
I have previously worked on studying the fundamental fluid instabilities and the resulting convection in idealised models of [internally cooled dry convection](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2024.108011) and [moist convection](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.4902). 

Prior to that I studied the assimilation of Rayleigh-Bénard convection [using Physics Informed Neural Networks](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epje/s10189-023-00276-9) and [using equation based dynamic methods](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0079625).

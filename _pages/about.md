Hi there! I am a physicist turned climate scientist with interests in atmospherc fluid flows, turbulence, thermal flows, clouds, rainfall. I am currently employed as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Atmospheric Transport Processes group](https://flexteam.univie.ac.at/) in the Department of Meteorology, University of Vienna. My current responsibilities include research on topics of atmospheric transport, development of the Flexpart model, teaching undergraduate and graduate level courses, and mentoring Master's thesis projects. I have a PhD in physics with expertise in fluid dynamics, turbulence, convection. 

In my free time I enjoy playing [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/lokahithagasthya), going on a [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/98088828) or curling up with a good (e-)book. 

I'm currently reading "India: A Million Mutinies Now" by V.S. Naipaul. (December 2025)
